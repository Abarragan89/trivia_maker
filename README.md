  ## Description
  ![markdown logo](./readmePhoto.png)
  Trivia game maker. This was inspired by my background in education. It was difficult to find a straight forward Jeopardy-like game. Users can make an account, create gameboards, save gameboards, search public gameboards, edit those public games (or not) and save them to their library. If a player gets a question correct, they proceed to the bonus round where they try to multiply their points. This adds a little bit of randomness and chance to the game.
